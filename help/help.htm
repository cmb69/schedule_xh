<p style="text-align:justify">Schedule_XH facilitates the coordination of meetings for members
(registered through <a href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Register_XH">Register_XH</a>
or <a href="http://frankziesing.de/cmsimple/en/?Welcome:Memberpages">Memberpages_XH &ge; 3.0</a>)
of your CMSimple_XH site.
It is similar to Doodle's service, but as the appointment dates have no semantic meaning to Schedule_XH,
it can be used for other votings as well.</p>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>To set up a planning/voting on a CMSimple page, use the following plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule(%NAME%, %OPTION_1%, %OPTION_2%, %OPTION_N%);}}}</pre>
<p>The parameters have the following meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>%NAME%</dt>
<dd>The name of the event or other voting. This is used as basename of the CSV file in which the results are stored,
so it may contain alphanumeric characters and minus signs only.</dd>
<dt>%OPTION_X%</dt>
<dd>The name of the option, which will be displayed as heading of the respective table column.
This is typically a date, but as it has no semantic meaning to Schedule_XH, can actually be any string.
Basically you can have as many options as you like.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not necessary to restrict access to this page to members;
if a visitor of your site is not logged in, he will just see the current results,
without being able to vote. So you can even place the planner in the template:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo schedule(%NAME%, %OPTION_1%, %OPTION_2%, %OPTION_N%);?&gt;</pre>
<p>However, if you want to restrict the voting to a certain user group resp. access level,
you have to place the planner on a page,
which can only be accessed by members with the respective authorization.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>To schedule a Christmas staff party:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule('christmas', 'Dec. 18th', 'Dec. 19th', 'Dec. 22nd');}}}</pre>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./schedule.jpg" alt="Screenshot"></div>
<p>To set up a voting about the color of the new team shirts:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule('shirts', 'red', 'green', 'blue');}}}</pre>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can have as many planners as you like;
just give them different names.</li>
<li>You can place the same planner on different pages;
just use the same name.</li>
<li>Your members can change their votes as often as they like.</li>
<li>You can change the options even after some members have already voted.
As the votes are assigned to the name of the option (not by position), this should work reasonably well.</li>
</ul>
