<h1 id="schedule_xh">Schedule_XH</h1>
<p>Schedule_XH facilitates the coordination of meetings for members (registered through <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/register_xh">Register_XH</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmsimple-xh/memberpages">Memberpages</a> of your CMSimple_XH site. It is similar to the Doodle service, but as the appointment dates have no semantic meaning to Schedule_XH, it can be used for other votings as well.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Schedule_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 and PHP ≥ 7.1.0. Schedule_XH also requires <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH</a> ≥ 1.6; if that is not already installed (see <em>Settings</em>→<em>Info</em>), get the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a>, and install it.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/schedule_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/doku.php/installation#plugins">CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>schedule/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories <code>config/</code>, <code>css/</code>, <code>languages/</code> and the data directory of the plugin.</li>
<li>Switch to <code>Schedule</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Schedule</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Schedule_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icons with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Schedule_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To set up a planning/voting on a CMSimple_XH page, use the following plugin call:</p>
<pre><code>{{{schedule(&#39;%NAME%&#39;, %SHOW_TOTALS%, %READ_ONLY%, %MULTI%, &#39;%OPTION_1%&#39;, &#39;%OPTION_2%&#39;, &#39;%OPTION_N%&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p>The parameters have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%NAME%</code>: The name of the event or other voting. This is used as basename of the CSV file in which the results are stored, so it may contain lowercase letters (<code>a</code>-<code>z</code>), digits (<code>0</code>-<code>9</code>) and dashes (<code>-</code>) only.</li>
<li><code>%SHOW_TOTALS%</code>: Whether the totals should be displayed: <code>true</code> (means yes) or <code>false</code> (means no). It is important to write this parameter without quotes. If you want to use the default value from the plugin configuration, you can omit this parameter, if you also omit the <code>%READ_ONLY%</code> and the <code>%MULTI%</code> parameter.</li>
<li><code>%READ_ONLY%</code>: Whether the planner should be read only: <code>true</code> (means yes) or <code>false</code> (means no). It is important to write this parameter without quotes. If you want to use the default value from the plugin configuration, you can omit this parameter, if you also omit the <code>%MULTI%</code> parameter.</li>
<li><code>%MULTI%</code>: Whether multiple options may be chosen for a single planner: <code>true</code> (means yes) or <code>false</code> (means no). It is important to write this parameter without quotes. If you want to use the default value from the plugin configuration, simply omit this parameter.</li>
<li><code>%OPTION_X%</code>: The name of the option, which will be displayed as heading of the respective table column. This is typically a date, but as it has no semantic meaning to Schedule_XH, it can actually be any string. Basically you can have as many options as you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not necessary to restrict access to this page to members; if visitors of your site are not logged in, they will just see the current results, without being able to vote. So you can even place the planner in the template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?=schedule(&#39;%NAME%&#39;, %SHOW_TOTALS%, %READ_ONLY%, %MULTI%, &#39;%OPTION_1%&#39;, &#39;%OPTION_2%&#39;, &#39;%OPTION_N%&#39;);?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>However, if you want to restrict the voting to a certain user group or access level, you have to place the planner on a page, which can only be accessed by members with the respective authorization.</p>
<h3 id="call-builder">Call Builder</h3>
<p>To simplify writing the plugin calls, there is a call builder in the back-end (<code>Plugins</code> → <code>Schedule</code> → <code>Call Builder</code>). You can enter the desired properties of the planning/voting; note that the options have to be entered one per line in the textarea. When you press <code>Build</code>, the complete plugin call will be shown in the textarea at the bottom. You can then copy &amp; paste that into the desired page.</p>
<p>You can also copy &amp; paste an existing plugin call into the textarea at the bottom, and when you press <code>Parse</code>, the properties of the planning/voting will be shown in the form. You can edit these, and press <code>Build</code> to get the modified plugin call.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>To schedule a Christmas staff party:</p>
<pre><code>{{{schedule(&#39;christmas&#39;, &#39;Dec. 18th&#39;, &#39;Dec. 19th&#39;, &#39;Dec. 22nd&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmb69/schedule_xh/master/help/christmas.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the voting widget</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the voting for the party date, you want to keep the planer, so everybody can see the results. In this case you want to set it read only. To use the <code>%READ_ONLY%</code> parameter, you also have to specify the <code>%SHOW_TOTALS%</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>{{{schedule(&#39;christmas&#39;, false, true, &#39;Dec. 18th&#39;, &#39;Dec. 19th&#39;, &#39;Dec. 22nd&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p>To set up a voting about the color of the new team shirts, that displays the voting totals below the table regardless of the respective configuration option:</p>
<pre><code>{{{schedule(&#39;shirts&#39;, true, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can have as many planners as you like; just give them different names.</li>
<li>You can place the same planner on different pages; just use the same name.</li>
<li>Your members can change their votes as often as they like.</li>
<li>You can change the options even after some members have already voted. As the votes are assigned to the name of the option (not by position), this should work reasonably well.</li>
</ul>
