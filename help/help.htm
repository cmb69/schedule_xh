<p style="text-align:justify">Schedule_XH facilitates the coordination of
meetings for members (registered through <a

href="http://frankziesing.de/cmsimple/en/?Welcome:Memberpages">Memberpages_XH</a>)
of your CMSimple_XH site. It is similar to Doodle's service, but as the
appointment dates have no semantic meaning to Schedule_XH, it can be used for
other votings as well.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>
<p><strong>Schedule_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments. It is
a so called release candidate. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Schedule_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6 and
PHP &ge; 5.1.2.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation"> CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory schedule/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, css/, languages/ and
the plugin's data folder.</li>
<li>Switch to "Schedule" in the back-end to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that Schedule_XH's data files could be accessed directly by calling
their URL. A .htaccess file to prohibit this is already contained in the default
data folder. For other servers or for custom data folders you have to take care
for yourself, that the data are protected from non authorized access.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select Plugins &rarr; Schedule.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Schedule_XH under "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icons with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Schedule_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To set up a planning/voting on a CMSimple page, use the following plugin
call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule('%NAME%', %SHOW_TOTALS%, %READ_ONLY%, %MULTI%, '%OPTION_1%', '%OPTION_2%', '%OPTION_N%');}}}</pre>
<p>The parameters have the following meaning:</p>
<dl>
<dt>%NAME%</dt>
<dd>The name of the event or other voting. This is used as basename of the CSV
file in which the results are stored, so it may contain lowercase letters (a-z),
digits (0-9) and minus signs (-) only.</dd>
<dt>%SHOW_TOTALS%</dt>
<dd>Whether the totals should be displayed: <em>true</em> (means yes) or
<em>false</em> (means no). It's important to write this parameter without
quotes. If you want to use the default value from the plugin configuration, you
can omit this parameter, if you also omit the %READ_ONLY% and the %MULTI%
parameter.</dd>
<dt>%READ_ONLY%</dt>
<dd>Whether the planner should be read only: <em>true</em> (means yes) or
<em>false</em> (means no). It's important to write this parameter without
quotes. If you want to use the default value from the plugin configuration, you
can omit this parameter, if you also omit the %MULTI% parameter.</dd>
<dt>%MULTI%</dt>
<dd>Whether multiple options may be chosen for a single planner: <em>true</em>
(means yes) or <em>false</em> (means no). It's important to write this parameter
without quotes. If you want to use the default value from the plugin
configuration, simply omit this parameter.</dd>
<dt>%OPTION_X%</dt>
<dd>The name of the option, which will be displayed as heading of the respective
table column. This is typically a date, but as it has no semantic meaning to
Schedule_XH, it can actually be any string. Basically you can have as many
options as you like.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not necessary to restrict access to this page to members; if a visitor
of your site is not logged in, he will just see the current results, without
being able to vote. So you can even place the planner in the template:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo schedule('%NAME%', %SHOW_TOTALS%, %READ_ONLY%, %MULTI%, '%OPTION_1%', '%OPTION_2%', '%OPTION_N%');?&gt;</pre>
<p>However, if you want to restrict the voting to a certain user group resp.
access level, you have to place the planner on a page, which can only be
accessed by members with the respective authorization.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To schedule a Christmas staff party:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule('christmas', 'Dec. 18th', 'Dec. 19th', 'Dec. 22nd');}}}</pre>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./schedule.jpg" alt="Screenshot"></div>
<p>After the voting for the party date, you want to keep the planer, so
everybody can see the results. In this case you'll want to set it read only. To
use the %READ_ONLY% parameter, you also have to specify the %SHOW_TOTALS%
parameter:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule('christmas', false, true, 'Dec. 18th', 'Dec. 19th', 'Dec. 22nd');}}}</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>To set up a voting about the color of the new team shirts, that displays the
voting totals below the table independently of the respective configuration
option:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:schedule('shirts', true, 'red', 'green', 'blue');}}}</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can have as many planners as you like; just give them different
names.</li>
<li>You can place the same planner on different pages; just use the same
name.</li>
<li>Your members can change their votes as often as they like.</li>
<li>You can change the options even after some members have already voted. As
the votes are assigned to the name of the option (not by position), this should
work reasonably well.</li>
</ul>
